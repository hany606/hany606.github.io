## About Me

<img class="img-icon" class="profile-picture" src="avatar.jpg" width="200px">

**Hello!** :wave: My name is Hany Hamed. I am a 3rd-year Computer Science (Robotics track) bachelor student at [Innopolis University](https://innopolis.university/en/).

Originally, I am from Egypt ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¬ and currently I am located in [Innopolis, Russia](https://innopolis.com/en/) to study my bachelor degree.

## Research Interest
At the current moment, I am interested in:
* Robot learning (Reinforcement Learning, Evolutionary Algorithms, ...etc)
* Multi-robotic system
* Sim2Real

I am interested in developing a systme of multiple robots that able to learn some behaviors in order to perform some tasks using learning-based methods, moroever, I am interested in transfering the learnt policy for the robots to the real world

I am curious to find out how far these kind of systems will learn the behavior like humans and creating different stratigies and behaviors.

My current research work is about creating a system of multiple drones that able to learn to chase each other as in [Pursuit and Evasion Games](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Pursuit-evasion).
